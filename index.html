            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate high school student with a strong interest in Math and Science. Actively involved in the Science Olympiad, Iâ€™ve developed skills in problem-solving, critical analysis, and creativity. As a natural leader, I excel in adapting quickly and supporting others, with a keen interest in pursuing a career in technology. My commitment to making a positive impact is demonstrated through my volunteer work with Feed My Starving Children. I am eager to apply my skills and enthusiasm to future projects and opportunities.
